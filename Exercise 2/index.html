<h1 id="webProgramming"><u>Web Programming</u></h1>
<p>Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just programming, which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and database technology.</p>

<h2 id="clientserver"><u>Client Server Model</h2></u></h2>
<p>The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. The client relies on sending a request to another program in order to access a service made available by a server. The server runs one or more programs that share resources with and distribute work among clients.

The client server relationship communicates in a request–response messaging pattern and must adhere to a common communications protocol, which formally defines the rules, language, and dialog patterns to be used. Client-server communication typically adheres to the TCP/IP protocol suite.

TCP protocol maintains a connection until the client and server have completed the message exchange. TCP protocol determines the best way to distribute application data into packets that networks can deliver, transfers packets to and receives packets from the network, and manages flow control and retransmission of dropped or garbled packets. IP is a connectionless protocol in which each packet traveling through the Internet is an independent unit of data unrelated to any other data units.

Client requests are organized and prioritized in a scheduling system, which helps servers cope in the instance of receiving requests from many distinct clients in a short space of time. The client-server approach enables any general-purpose computer to expand its capabilities by utilizing the shared resources of other hosts. Popular client-server applications include email, the World Wide Web, and network printing.

<h2 id="HTTP"><u>HTTP</h2></u></h2>
<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for transferring files -- such as text, images, sound, video and other multimedia files -- over the web. As soon as a user opens their web browser, they are indirectly using HTTP. HTTP is an application protocol that runs on top of the TCP/IP suite of protocols, which forms the foundation of the internet. The latest version of HTTP is HTTP/2, which was published in May 2015. It is an alternative to its predecessor, HTTP 1.1, but does not it make obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="httprequest"><u>HTTP REQUEST</u></h2>
<p>An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server.
To make the request, the client uses components of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which includes the information needed to access the resource. The components of a URL explains URLs.
Each HTTP header is followed by a carriage return line feed (CRLF). After the last of the HTTP headers, an additional CRLF is used (to give an empty line), and then any message body begins.

<h2 id="dynamicwebpage"><u>Dynamic Webpage</u></h2>
<p>A dynamic page displays different content for different users while retaining the same layout and design. Such pages, usually written in CGI, AJAX, ASP or ASP.NET, take more time to load than simple static pages. They’re frequently implemented to show information that changes frequently, e.g., weather updates or stock prices.

Dynamic pages usually contain application programs for different services and require server-side resources like databases. A database allows the page creator to separate the website’s design from the content to be displayed to users. Once they upload content into the database, it is retrieved by the website in response to a user request.</p> 
<h2 id="applicationserver"><u>Application Server</u></h2>
<p>
Applications come in all shapes, sizes, and use cases. In a world where we rely on a host of critical business processes, application servers are the high-powered computers providing application resources to users and web clients.
Application servers physically or virtually sit between database servers storing application data and web servers communicating with clients. App servers and akin middleware are the operating systems supporting an application’s development and delivery. Whether it’s a desktop, mobile, or web app, application servers play a critical role in connecting a world of devices.

<h2 id="websecurity"><u>Web Security</u></h2>
<p>
Web security must be a critical priority for every organization. Along with email, the web is one of the top vectors for cyberattacks. The web and the use of DNS services specifically are part of 91% of all malware attacks, and email and web together are a key part for 99% of successful breaches.
While the importance of web security is undisputed, protecting against web security threats grows more challenging each day. From thwarting attacks to dealing with limits in skills and resources, IT security departments face serious challenges when trying to secure the web.
In the past, security teams have deployed a collection of on-premises solutions to manage email and web security. But increasingly organizations are turning to comprehensive email and web security solutions – via integrated, cloud-based technologies that simplify the task and reduce the cost of reducing risk. And because attackers often leverage email and web channels together, a seamless and scalable strategy for protecting both is essential.
